Assembly Darkrooms (formerly E5 Process), is a membership based open-access darkroom in Dalston, East London.

With a strong focus on supporting independent analogue processes and experimentation, we offer a unique space and community for artists, photographers and creatives.

Facilities include traditional black and white wet printing, colour printing and a dedicated space for printing projects such as books & zines, commercial work or exhibition work.

Run and maintained by volunteers, Assembly Darkrooms is charitable unincorporated association and relies on membership to offer its unique range of facilities.
