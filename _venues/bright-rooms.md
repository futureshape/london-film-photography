Our spacious darkroom was designed and hand built by us to provide a comfortable & fresh environment to work in. Experience the beauty of analogue printing on one of our De Vere 504 enlargers with your choice of light source. We also have a 10×8 horizontal enlarger for large format printing. You can also use our facilities to develop and scan film as part of your darkroom hours.
