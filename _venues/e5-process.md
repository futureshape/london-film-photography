E5 Process is a volunteer-run charitable unincorporated association situated just off the famous Chatsworth Road in East London. We pride ourselves both as darkroom and also educational centre for Silver Gelatin and Alternative Photographic printing and processes.

We offer darkroom space for both members and non-members and also a number of beginner and refresher courses, in a variety of photographic printing processes. In fact, we actively encourage you to come in and get your hands dirty!
