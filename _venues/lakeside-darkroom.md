Lakeside Darkroom is a membership-based, open access community black & white darkroom.

It is aimed toward women and those with little financial resources who practise analogue photography.

The facility provides a high-quality darkroom and post-production facilities at an affordable price, enabling practitioners to continue their research on analogue photography while also building a community.
