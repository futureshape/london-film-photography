Lakeside Darkroom (LKSD) is a Community Interest Company (CIC) with a strong feminist ethos, dedicated to analogue photography.  Founded in August 2022, LKSD is more than just a darkroom—it’s a space where creativity, experimentation, and community come together.

At LKSD, analogue photography is more than a medium—it’s a  tool for connection, empowerment, and creative resistance. Join us to develop your practice in a space where you can slow down, experiment, and grow within a truly supportive community.
