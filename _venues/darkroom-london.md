darkroom is a fantastic new facility in Camden Town in north London where you can work comfortably to produce high quality black and white photographic prints.

We have a range of enlargers that will satisfy most photographers’ needs, ranging from easy to use Kaiser 35mm/120 enlargers to a range of De Vere and LPLs capable of handling everything from 35mm to 5 x 4.

Initially, you will need to attend a short Induction session with one of our experienced technicians, to ensure you understand how all the equipment works and what our standard operating practices are.

Once inducted, as a member you can book an enlarger for a session of independent printing. darkroom provides all essential chemicals (developer, stop, fix, etc.), so all you need to bring is your own paper. darkroom even provides a processing service for films received at least 48 hours in advance.
