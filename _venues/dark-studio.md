Dark Studio is a brand new darkroom in the heart of Shoreditch. Opened in March 2019, our space was designed from the ground up to be the perfect place to develop and print black and white photography.

With a super relaxed vibe, our space is great for both darkroom beginners and seasoned vets with a full range of equipment available including: A custom built lightbox table, 5x printing booths, a heated drying rack, custom build sinks - large enough for A0 prints and the specific chemicals you need. We also sell paper, film and cameras at our reception.
