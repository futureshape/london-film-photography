The Camera Club is one of the longest running photographic societies in the world. From the earliest days, printing has been a key element for dedicated photographers in producing exhibition quality prints.

The Camera Club has four separate darkrooms for individual working, grouped around a general area containing RC and FB driers and two film driers.
