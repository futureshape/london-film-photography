Rapid Eye was founded in 1996 as an affordable London colour darkroom and film processing facility, where photographers could experiment with ideas and techniques.

Over the years the darkroom has grown and sustained a community of like-minded photographers who strive to create interesting groundbreaking quality images which you will find in the best galleries, magazines and books around the world.

Based in the heart of London's Shoreditch, we are still going strong,  providing a stable hub for professional photographers, photography enthusiasts and students - everyone is welcome.
