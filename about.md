This site is a comprehensive listing of [film photography darkrooms](/) and,
in the future, shops and processing labs currently open in London, UK.

Film photography is flourishing again, and after a few years of darkrooms
closing down in London, there are now new ones opening up.

Explore the site to find a [darkroom in London near you](/), and experience the magic
of making your own prints!

## Where does this information come from?

I collected information about each darkroom from their official website and
other online sources. In the future, I plan to visit each of the darkrooms to
gather additional information and take more photos.

## How do I book a darkroom?

Get in touch directly the darkroom you're interested in - all of them have a
slightly different process for becoming a member (if that's necessary) and
booking time to use the darkroom.

Sorry, you can't make a booking directly through this site.

## Who made this and why?

I'm [Alex](https://twitter.com/futureshape), and photography is one of my many
hobbies. Over the last couple of years, I re-discovered film photography and
started developing my own film and making prints.

I helped set up and manage a [community darkroom](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Group:Darkroom) at
[London Hackspace](https://london.hackspace.org.uk/).

As the Hackspace is currently searching for a new home, I started looking for
somewhere else to continue printing my photos. I found it hard to get
information about the different darkrooms available in London, so I thought I'd
make this easier for the next people looking for the same thing.

I don't make any money through this site, and none of the darkrooms have paid
to be listed here.
